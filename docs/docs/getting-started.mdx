Welcome to `react-native-video-toolkit` . This guide will help you get started with installing and using the video player component in your React Native application.

Due to lack of mac machine, I am unable to add TurboModules support for iOS. So, contributions are welcome. for iOS support üôè

### Android

No additional steps are typically required for Android after `npm install` or `yarn add`.

## Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the `VideoPlayer` component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { SafeAreaView, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
import { VideoPlayer, DefaultLayout } from 'react-native-video-toolkit';

function App(): React.JSX.Element {
  const videoSource = {
    uri: 'https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4',
  };

  return (
    /* Don't wrap with SafeAreaView as it adds,
     extra padding which breaks the layout in fullscreen mode*/
    <VideoProvider>
      <View style={styles.videoContainer}>
        <VideoPlayer source={videoSource}>
          <DefaultLayout />
        </VideoPlayer>
      </View>
    </VideoProvider>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#000',
  },
  videoContainer: {
    width: '100%',
    height: 200,
    backgroundColor: '#000',
  },
});

export default App;
```
